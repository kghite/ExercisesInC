# Reflection 2

## Sprint Reflection
### Personal Learning Goals

* Gain proficiency in C
* Understand the fundamental structure and implementation of an OS
* Understand and implement threading in C (write OS side on Arduino for project)


### Reflection
During this sprint, I continued to personally focus on working through the readings and extra resources to understand the structure and implementation behind an operating system.  I also worked through the Head First C exercises and other outside personal and class projects to improve my C proficiency.

Our project team has continued to use the eduScrum model, keeping our Trello board up to date to keep the project on track.  We have moved past the research phase into finishing our MVP implementation and beginning the documentation process.  Every team member has a solid understanding of our threading library implementation, and we are moving forward to convert the memory allocation and context switching processes over to the Arduino architecture.

Though we lost a team member at the beginning of the sprint, we have been consistently scheduling hackathon sessions that allow us to effectively move forward on the project.

Overall, I have been working during this sprint both individually and within our team toward both my personal learning goals and the final project goals.

## Exam Question
### Question

What are two potential problems that could occur in a system due to memory leaks? 

### Solution

Look for two of: 

* Running out of physical memory 
* Processes taking up more space than necessary
* Limited space for malloc to use
* Running out of addresses to allocated
