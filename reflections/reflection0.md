### Personal Learning Goals - Sprint 1

* Gain proficiency in C
* Understand the fundamental structure and implementation of an OS
* Understand and implement threading in C (write OS side on Arduino for project)

### Team Formation

Our team formed around several shared learning goals.  Every member of the team wants to focus on quickly ramping up their C skills and OS knowledge in the first sprints.  We also had common interests in OS design, networking, and embedded computing that allowed us to choose a project topic that suited everyone's interests.

### Dividing Responsibilities

Hannah offered to be the scrum master based on the fact that she had not recently had the position during other projects.  Currently, everyone has the same reading responsibilities, and we will split up other tasks evenly using Trello in the future.

### Sprint Backlog

We determined as a team that for now we will all complete all of the readings rather than splitting them to read in parallel.  This is based on the goal that we set to do as much reasearch as possible during the first sprint to get an indepth background on topics around our project.  We are also working to read ahead in both **ThinkOS** and **Head First C** to gain proficiency in C and a better understanding of the OS structure we will be implementing.

### Concerns

Moving forward, we have a good team structure and basic reading backlog to help us start our project.  The only main concern is ensuring that we gain enough background knowledge to be able to make decisions that will lead to a meaningful, well-scoped project.
